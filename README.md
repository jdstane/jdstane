By day, I'm an **AI Data Trainer**, helping refine machine learning models. By night, I’m a **developer and tech enthusiast**, always exploring new ideas and building projects in my free time. I have a deep interest in **AI**, **automation**, and **web development**, and I enjoy integrating AI into the tools I create.

<br>

### 🔍 What I'm Into  
- 🚀 **AI & Automation** – Finding ways to integrate AI into software, from NLP to process automation.  
- 🛠 **Web Development & SaaS** – Currently building a SaaS Management Platform (SMP) and experimenting with Bubble.io & API integrations.  
- 🐍 **Python & APIs** – Learning how to create smarter, more efficient applications.  

<br>

### 🤝 Collaboration  

I've spent a lot of time developing solo, but I'd love to **collaborate on exciting projects**—whether it's AI-driven applications, automation tools, or something unexpected. If you have an idea, let's talk!
